### This project currently contains my explorations in toon shading! I have implemented several existing toon shaders, dithering algorithms, and creative shading techniques to explore levels of abstraction, depth, and lighting in toonstyle rendering.

## To Run:

If the link is not working, please download the source code. Using npm, run "npm install", then "npm start". Go to localhost:2023 in your browser, and play around with a variety of shaders, models, and lighting scenarios!
